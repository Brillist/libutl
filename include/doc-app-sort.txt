   \section app_sort_introduction Introduction

   \b sort is like UNIX sort.  It uses utl::multiKeyQuickSort() to quickly sort lines of text.

   \section app_sort_instructions Instructions

   You can give the \b -r switch to specify a reversed sort order.  The lines of text to be
   sorted are read in from standard input, and once EOF is reached, the sort is performed, and
   the sorted lines are written to standard output.

   For example:

   \code
   adam@phat:~/src/libutl/apps/sort> ./sort
   // I type the following on 'sort' stdin (my terminal)
   dabc
   abcd
   efgh^D
   // 'sort' prints the following on its stdout (my terminal)
   abcd
   dabc
   efgh
   \endcode
*/
